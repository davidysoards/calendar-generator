# React Calendar Generator ðŸ“†

This project is deployed via GitHub pages at [React Calendar Generator](https://davidysoards.github.io/calendar-generator/).

## Create React App

This project was created using 'create-react-app'.

## date-fns

I used the oh-so-helpful date-fns date utility library to help with the necessary date calculations.

## Styles

I used **SCSS** to write the styles for the components that make up this application.

- 1 sheet for resets
- 1 sheet for color and size variables
- 1 main stylesheet

The design is responsize and reduces in size and layout @ under 768px.

**No CSS frameworks were used.** The layout uses Flexbox and good ol' HTML Tables.

Normalize.css is used and I added some additional resets of my own.

I used a System Font Stack to help the app load nice 'n fast!

The Calendar Icon is from an icon set named Glyphicons. I exported it from Sketch and optimized it w/ SVGOMG.
