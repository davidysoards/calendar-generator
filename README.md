# React Calendar Generator

This project will be deployed via GitHub pages at [React Calendar Generator](https://davidysoards.github.io/calendar-generator-react).

## Create React App

This project was created using 'create-react-app'.

## Styles

I used **SCSS** to write the styles for the components that make up this application.

- 1 sheet for resets
- 1 sheet for color and size variables
- 1 main stylesheet

The \$td-size variable can be adjusted to change the size of the entire table.<br />
It is currently set to 70px.

**No CSS frameworks were used.** The layout uses Flexbox and good ol' HTML Tables.

Normalize.css is used and I added some additional resets of my own.

I used a System Font Stack to help the app load nice 'n fast!

The Calendar Icon is from an icon set named Glyphicons. I exported it from Sketch and optimized it w/ SVGOMG.
